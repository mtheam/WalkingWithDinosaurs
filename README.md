Augmented Reality demo with Google Cardboard


This is a Google Cardboard prototype that explored the idea of "living fossils". The idea was to film a 360 degree video that would be viewed using a Google Cardboard, and when a particular fossil was viewed, that creature would come to life in VR. I captured the video and created the project using Unity and sourced 3D models.
